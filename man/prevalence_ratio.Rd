\title{Prevalence ratio of an outcome between groups.}
\usage{
prevalence_ratio(outcome_data, groups, outcomes, data_name = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{outcome_data}{Data providing the outcomes against the groups. Can be provided as raw
(i.e., participant-level) data, detailing row-by-row the the group and
outcome for each participant. Can also be provided as aggregate data.
Valid input types are:
  data.frame with 2 columns and a row for each participant, where the
    first column contains the participant's group, second column
    contains the participant's outcome;
  matrix containing a contingency table of the groups against the
    outcomes, with 2 columns (one for the 'outcome occurred' state and
    one for the 'outcome did not occur' state), and a named row for each
    group;
  list with 4 named elements, group1_t, group1_f, group2_t and group2_f,
    giving the number of participants in each category, where group1 is
    the control group and group2 is the intervention group, and t is the
    'outcome occurred' state and f is the 'outcome did not occur' state.}

\item{groups}{Character vector of the groups in the order in which they should be
analysed, starting with the control group. For list data the parameter
will define the labels to be applied in the output, and default values
will be used if not specified.}

\item{outcomes}{Character vector of length 2 specifying the labels used in the data for
the two outcome states, with the 'outcome occurred' state listed first and
the 'outcome did not occur' state second. For list data the parameter will
define the labels to the be applied in the output, and default values
will be used if not specified.}
}
\value{
The prevalence ratio, indicating the prevalence in group 2, relative
  to group 1. Returns a list of objects if there are more than 2 groups.
}
\description{
Calculates the prevalence ratio of a binary / dichotomous outcome
between two or more groups, from individual or aggregate data.
}
\details{
The prevalence ratio is defined for binary / dichotomous outcomes in a
trial. In each group, the prevalence is the number of participants for whom
the outcome occured as a proportion of the total number of participants in
that group. For example, if 15 participants out of 100 in a group achieved
the outcome in question, the prevalence for that group would be 0.15 (15%).

The prevalence ratio is the ratio of the prevalence of the outcome in an
intervention group to the prevalence in the control group.

As a relative measure, presenting the prevalence ratio on its own can tend
to create an impression of a larger effect than an absolute measure.
Consider using in association with an absolute measure, such as
\code{\link{prevalence_difference}}.

The function is able to handle both individual and aggregate data.
Individual data should be provided as a data.frame with two columns.
Aggregate data can be provided as either a named list or a matrix with
named rows and columns.
